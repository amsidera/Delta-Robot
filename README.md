# Delta-Robot

Design and manufacturing of a delta robot for the course Robotics. Coding the robot to control it remotely using Labview.

Several interfaces have been made in LabView, to implement different functionalities: manual control, automatic control and inverse kinematics. Functions covered by the program:
 - Kinematic model: obtaining the relevant angular coordinates in the motors from those of the effector.
 - Generation of trajectories: including in the MathScript the modification that is shown in the video of the project.
 - IHM: position and clamp control.
 - Positioning of the zero point: using the HOME button.
